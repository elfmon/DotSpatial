1) Set The bitness of DotSpatial.Data.Rasters.GdalExtension to x64 or x86 and then build it.
2) Build the corresponding GdalExtension64 or GdalExtension32
3) Build your application with the applicable bitness (you can leave all the supporting libraries as AnyCPU).

By default we have things setup to run as 32bit on 64 bit machines.
